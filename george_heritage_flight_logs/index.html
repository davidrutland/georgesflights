      <p>Log books are used to keep records of events and training. While we only have one of George’s logbooks, they give clues to day-to-day life of a RAF rear gunner in the early 1940s.</p>

<p><em>10 hours and 10 minutes - Course passed with ‘average’ results.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_results.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_training_logs_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log training page" /></a></p>

<p><em>Logs from training as an air gunner with 148 squadron at RAF Evanton. The planes listed include the Blackburn Botha - a notoriously dangerous, unreliable, and underpowered plane, which killed many crew. Pilots listed include F/O Ebbenrytter, Sgt Mironozuk, F/O Lovelace, Sgt Joworoskie, Sgt Eckert, Sgt Gech, Sgt Westwood and Flight sgt Jewell.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_training_training_harwell" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_training_training_harwell_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log training page" /></a></p>

<p>More training - this time at Harwell in Oxfordshire. Pilots were F/O Berry and Sgt Crump. Their Wellington crashed on 20/10/1941, but the crew was back in the air a week later.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_training_training_harwell_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_training_training_harwell_2_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log training page" /></a></p>

<p><em>Aircraft testing of Wellington 9029 at Harwell - P/O Hartley as a stand-in pilot.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_to_fiume.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_to_fiume_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log showing aircraft moving across Europe" /></a></p>

<p><em>In December 1941, Wellington 9029 made its way from base to Fiume (currently Rijeka in Croatia) via Portreath, Gibraltar, and Luqa, on the island of Malta. At the time Fiume was occupied by the Italian armed forces, but there is no onward travel and no mention of bombs being dropped. The flight from Luqa to Fiume was unsual in that George was acting as forward gunner instead of his usual rear gun position. Pilots during this period were P/O Crump and F/lt McFarlane. Congratulations to Crump on his recent promotion</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_arrive_kabrit.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_arrive_kabrit_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>The start of 1942 saw the crew arriving at RAF Kabrit in the Suez Canal Zone of Egypt. Details are brief, but we can see that the Wellington flew from RAF Kabrit to landing ground 09 at Bir Koriayim - presumably for refuelling, before continuing on to Ey Zuetina and dropping seven 500lb bombs, and returning along the same route. Ey Zuetina (now Zuwetina) - boasted an oil refinery and a small harbour. A week before this mission, George was photographed after climbing the Great pyramid.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_feb42.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_feb42_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>February 1942 was a busier month for the crew. Operating out out of LG09 again, they flew several missions against axis targets in Libya, including the Berca Aerodrome, and Benghazi - also attacking military convoys. One mission to Cyprus, but no time to enjoy the excellent beaches.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_feb42_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_feb42_2_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>Still in February of 1942, the Wellington crew flew out of LG 09 at Bir Koriayim attacking Benghazi again, as well as Heraklion on the occupied island of Crete.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_march42.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_march42_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>The first half of March 1942 saw the crew in a different Wellington, and flying out of Kabrit to new landing grounds - LG 106 (near Al Dabaa, approximately 300 miles west of Kabrit) and LG 109 (at Sidi Barrani, 200 miles further west still, and currently designated as a military area). From here they attacked shipping facilities (moles) at Benghazi. It’s probable that moving to LG 109 allowed the Wellington to use less fuel and carry more bombs. The crew only stopped at LG 109 on their way to Benghazi, not on their way back. Side note: The following year, when Squadron leader Thomas Prickett was <a href="https://ibccdigitalarchive.lincoln.ac.uk/omeka/files/fullsize/1548/30167/MPrickettTO40427-161011-03.2.jpg" target="_blank">recommended</a> for the DFC, it was noted that he, “suffered from spinal arthritis, a serious handicap, especially long sorties, which he has endured uncomplainingly and with great fortitude.” The return trip from LG 109 to Benghazi must have been hell.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_march42_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_march42_2_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>A quick jaunt to blow up the runway at Heraklion, then back in time for tea at the Empire club, Cairo. SBC stands for Small Bomb Containers. These were usually loaded with incendiaries for starting fires.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_april42.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_april42_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>With the weather growing warmer, early April 1942 saw the crew using the Al Dabaa landing ground to stage multiple attacks on Berca and Benghazi - dropping 500lb bombs and incendiaries. After a short break following the return to Kabrit on April 6th, a planned return to Al Dabaa was cancelled in favour of tearing up the aerodrome at Heraklion - returning to Kabrit on April 10th. The airfield, taken following the battle of Heraklion in May 1941, was essential for transporting supplies and reinforcements to Axis forces in North Africa.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_april42_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_april42_2_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p>No more flying in April after the 10th. Possibly time off, but more likely, some training.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_may42.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_may42_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>The first mission of May 1942 saw George dropping leaflets instead of bombs onto Heraklion. It is likely that these were exhortations to the Italian troops to lay down their arms and surrender. The log also mentions a mysterious ‘special mission’. After three days of downtime in Cairo, it was back to business as usual with five 500lb bombs dropped onto Benghazi on May 12th</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_june42.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_june42_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>June 1942 sees George’s log mentioning LG 109 by its proper name - Sidi Barrani - for the first time, indicating that it had by now grown from a simple desert landing ground and refuelling stop into a settlement of some size. Both engines were exchanged at Kabrit, ready for some hard flying. From June 11th, entries are written in pencil and then traced over in heavy red pen. The handwriting is less casual. Operations against Piraeus in Greece, and the inland, southern part of the Libyan city of Derna met with heavy opposition. The second run at Derna saw an issue with the turret and the Wellington turning back. These operations were likely part in support of the Battle of Gazala - which was a crushing defeat for the allies. June 13th in particular was known as ‘Black Saturday’. The pilot, P/O Crump has been replaced by P/O Parry.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_june42_.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_june42_2_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>The battle of Gazala continues, and George is now acting in support of ground troops. In addition to the usual targets of airfields and shipping facilities, the Wellington is attacking railways, and convoys of tanks and transports. A sortie to Heraklion was abandoned due to lightning. June saw George in the air for more than 78 hours, and accounted for almost on equarter of his total airtime to date. Tobruk fell to the German Afrika Korps on June 21st - a dark day, but one without which the greatest beer advert in history, ‘Ice Cold in Alex’, could not have been made.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/flight_log_july42.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/flight_log_july42_lo_res.png" alt="Flight log book" /></a></p>

<p><em>This is the final operational page in this logbook - although we know that George was in Egypt for at least the rest of the year. There is only one operation - against the harbour facilities at Tobruk, now in axis hands.</em></p>

<p><em>The inside back cover of George’s log book shows all of the bases he was stationed as air gunner, and the aircraft in which he flew during this period.</em></p>
