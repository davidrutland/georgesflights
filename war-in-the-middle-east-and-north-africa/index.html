      <p>A collection of wartime photos taken while on duty and at leisure in the hot places of the world. George was based on Malta and in Egypt, acting as a rear gunner in a Wellington bomber as it attacked Axis installations in North Africa, Italy, and the occupied Greek Islands.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/jeep.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/jeep_lo_res.png" alt="George Heritage driving a Jeep" /></a></p>

<p><em>A rare picture of George driving. The vehicle is stationary and there is a man squatting on the bonnet, so who knows?</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/behind_a_fence.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/behind_a_fence_lo_res.png" alt="George Heritage behind a fence" /></a></p>

<p><em>Chilling in Cairo. George is on the left; the other man is possibly Corporal Gordon</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/148_squadron.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/148_squadron_lo_res.png" alt="Members of 148 Squadron" /></a></p>

<p><em>A postcard portrait of members of 148 Squadron, 338 Wing. The text on the back of the photo reads:</em></p>

<p>“Me, McClelland, Bethel, Stewart, Davies, Thomas<br />
Gordon, Jones, Dwyer, Forshaw, Sarjeant, alec? Gibbons,<br />
Inky, Seatson,<br />
Curry, Flogel, Iley, Bartlett, Williams,<br />
Bell”</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/Wellington_bomber_1.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/Wellington_bomber_1_lo_res.png" alt="A Wellington Bomber" /></a></p>

<p><em>A Wellington Bomber - heavily used. Note the chipped paintwork, flat tyre, and that a large section of the engine is missing. This picture was probably taken during the double engine change at Kabrit between June 4th and 9th 1942.</em></p>

<p><em>A group of servicemen outside the Empire club, Cairo. George is second from left. The text on the back of the photo reads:</em></p>

<p>Cairo
November /42</p>

<p>Dick, Myself, Bill,
Billy Barr</p>

<p>Taken outside “Empire” Club</p>

<p>McMinn</p>

<p>R.G. 10. (Form)</p>

<p><em>Dick is Dick Fenner. George and Dick were friends in Liverpool - living on opposite sides of the road - who joined up at the same time. Dick signed up with the army, and they did not see each other again, until this chance meetup in Cairo.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/george_heritage_great_pyramid.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/george_heritage_great_pyramid_lo_res.png" alt="George Heritage after climbing the great pyramid" /></a></p>

<p><em>Being at war for three years, doesn’t mean you stop appreciating culture. Here is George Heritage after surveying Cairo from the summit of the great pyramid in January 1942.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/pyramid_caption.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/pyramid_caption_lo_res.png" alt="Text on the back of a postcard" /></a></p>

<p><em>20/1/42 Tired out after climbing to the top of the largest pyramid. Lots of love. George XXXXXX XXX. The picture was taken a week before starting active operations against Ey Zuetina</em></p>

<p><em>Fun fact:  In early 1942, 148 Squadron “achieved the dubious, and possibly unique, distinction of having all its NCO aircrew flying operationally whilst on charges of insubordination, with five of them ultimately being court-martialed.” Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trusty-End-History-Squadron-1918-1945/dp/1911255185"> Trusty to the End: The History of 148 (Special Duties) Squadron 1918-1945 by Oliver Clutton-Brock</a></em></p>

<p><em>A Wellington crew of 148 Squadron in the Egyptian desert - presumably George is the photographer in this shot.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/building_in_the_desert.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/building_in_the_desert_lo_res.png" alt="148 squadron in the desert" /></a></p>

<p><em>This is either part of a plane or part of a tent under construction</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/waiting_for_the_tent.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/waiting_for_the_tent_lo_res.png" alt="148 squadron in the desert" /></a></p>

<p><em>Others look on - anxious to see what is being built.</em></p>

<p><em>Definitely a tent. This is likely to be at LG109 - Sidi Barrani</em></p>
