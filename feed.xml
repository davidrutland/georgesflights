&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rare picture of George driving. The vehicle is stationary and there is a man squatting on the bonnet, so who knows?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Wellington Bomber - heavily used. Note the chipped paintwork, flat tyre, and that a large section of the engine is missing. This picture was probably taken during the double engine change at Kabrit between June 4th and 9th 1942.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McMinn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R.G. 10. (Form)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dick is Dick Fenner. George and Dick were friends in Liverpool - living on opposite sides of the road - who joined up at the same time. Dick signed up with the army, and they did not see each other again, until this chance meetup in Cairo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being at war for three years, doesn’t mean you stop appreciating culture. Here is George Heritage after surveying Cairo from the summit of the great pyramid in January 1942.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/pyramid_caption.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pyramid_caption_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Text on the back of a postcard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;20/1/42 Tired out after climbing to the top of the largest pyramid. Lots of love. George XXXXXX XXX. The picture was taken a week before starting active operations against Ey Zuetina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact:  In early 1942, 148 Squadron “achieved the dubious, and possibly unique, distinction of having all its NCO aircrew flying operationally whilst on charges of insubordination, with five of them ultimately being court-martialed.” Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trusty-End-History-Squadron-1918-1945/dp/1911255185&quot;&gt; Trusty to the End: The History of 148 (Special Duties) Squadron 1918-1945 by Oliver Clutton-Brock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Wellington crew of 148 Squadron in the Egyptian desert - presumably George is the photographer in this shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is either part of a plane or part of a tent under construction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Others look on - anxious to see what is being built.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Definitely a tent. This is likely to be at LG109 - Sidi Barrani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logs from training as an air gunner with 148 squadron at RAF Evanton. The planes listed include the Blackburn Botha - a notoriously dangerous, unreliable, and underpowered plane, which killed many crew. Pilots listed include F/O Ebbenrytter, Sgt Mironozuk, F/O Lovelace, Sgt Joworoskie, Sgt Eckert, Sgt Gech, Sgt Westwood and Flight sgt Jewell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More training - this time at Harwell in Oxfordshire. Pilots were F/O Berry and Sgt Crump. Their Wellington crashed on 20/10/1941, but the crew was back in the air a week later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_training_training_harwell_2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_training_training_harwell_2_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log training page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aircraft testing of Wellington 9029 at Harwell - P/O Hartley as a stand-in pilot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In December 1941, Wellington 9029 made its way from base to Fiume (currently Rijeka in Croatia) via Portreath, Gibraltar, and Luqa, on the island of Malta. At the time Fiume was occupied by the Italian armed forces, but there is no onward travel and no mention of bombs being dropped. The flight from Luqa to Fiume was unsual in that George was acting as forward gunner instead of his usual rear gun position. Pilots during this period were P/O Crump and F/lt McFarlane. Congratulations to Crump on his recent promotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_arrive_kabrit.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_arrive_kabrit_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The start of 1942 saw the crew arriving at RAF Kabrit in the Suez Canal Zone of Egypt. Details are brief, but we can see that the Wellington flew from RAF Kabrit to landing ground 09 at Bir Koriayim - presumably for refuelling, before continuing on to Ey Zuetina and dropping seven 500lb bombs, and returning along the same route. Ey Zuetina (now Zuwetina) - boasted an oil refinery and a small harbour. A week before this mission, George was photographed after climbing the Great pyramid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_feb42.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_feb42_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;February 1942 was a busier month for the crew. Operating out out of LG09 again, they flew several missions against axis targets in Libya, including the Berca Aerodrome, and Benghazi - also attacking military convoys. One mission to Cyprus, but no time to enjoy the excellent beaches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_feb42_2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_feb42_2_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still in February of 1942, the Wellington crew flew out of LG 09 at Bir Koriayim attacking Benghazi again, as well as Heraklion on the occupied island of Crete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_march42.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_march42_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first half of March 1942 saw the crew in a different Wellington, and flying out of Kabrit to new landing grounds - LG 106 (near Al Dabaa, approximately 300 miles west of Kabrit) and LG 109 (at Sidi Barrani, 200 miles further west still, and currently designated as a military area). From here they attacked shipping facilities (moles) at Benghazi. It’s probable that moving to LG 109 allowed the Wellington to use less fuel and carry more bombs. The crew only stopped at LG 109 on their way to Benghazi, not on their way back. Side note: The following year, when Squadron leader Thomas Prickett was &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibccdigitalarchive.lincoln.ac.uk/omeka/files/fullsize/1548/30167/MPrickettTO40427-161011-03.2.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for the DFC, it was noted that he, “suffered from spinal arthritis, a serious handicap, especially long sorties, which he has endured uncomplainingly and with great fortitude.” The return trip from LG 109 to Benghazi must have been hell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_march42_2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_march42_2_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quick jaunt to blow up the runway at Heraklion, then back in time for tea at the Empire club, Cairo. SBC stands for Small Bomb Containers. These were usually loaded with incendiaries for starting fires.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_april42.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_april42_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the weather growing warmer, early April 1942 saw the crew using the Al Dabaa landing ground to stage multiple attacks on Berca and Benghazi - dropping 500lb bombs and incendiaries. After a short break following the return to Kabrit on April 6th, a planned return to Al Dabaa was cancelled in favour of tearing up the aerodrome at Heraklion - returning to Kabrit on April 10th. The airfield, taken following the battle of Heraklion in May 1941, was essential for transporting supplies and reinforcements to Axis forces in North Africa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_april42_2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_april42_2_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more flying in April after the 10th. Possibly time off, but more likely, some training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_may42.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_may42_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first mission of May 1942 saw George dropping leaflets instead of bombs onto Heraklion. It is likely that these were exhortations to the Italian troops to lay down their arms and surrender. The log also mentions a mysterious ‘special mission’. After three days of downtime in Cairo, it was back to business as usual with five 500lb bombs dropped onto Benghazi on May 12th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_june42.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flight_log_june42_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight log book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 1942 sees George’s log mentioning LG 109 by its proper name - Sidi Barrani - for the first time, indicating that it had by now grown from a simple desert landing ground and refuelling stop into a settlement of some size. Both engines were exchanged at Kabrit, ready for some hard flying. From June 11th, entries are written in pencil and then traced over in heavy red pen. The handwriting is less casual. Operations against Piraeus in Greece, and the inland, southern part of the Libyan city of Derna met with heavy opposition. The second run at Derna saw an issue with the turret and the Wellington turning back. These operations were likely part in support of the Battle of Gazala - which was a crushing defeat for the allies. June 13th in particular was known as ‘Black Saturday’. The pilot, P/O Crump has been replaced by P/O Parry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battle of Gazala continues, and George is now acting in support of ground troops. In addition to the usual targets of airfields and shipping facilities, the Wellington is attacking railways, and convoys of tanks and transports. A sortie to Heraklion was abandoned due to lightning. June saw George in the air for more than 78 hours, and accounted for almost on equarter of his total airtime to date. Tobruk fell to the German Afrika Korps on June 21st - a dark day, but one without which the greatest beer advert in history, ‘Ice Cold in Alex’, could not have been made.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the final operational page in this logbook - although we know that George was in Egypt for at least the rest of the year. There is only one operation - against the harbour facilities at Tobruk, now in axis hands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside back cover of George’s log book shows all of the bases he was stationed as air gunner, and the aircraft in which he flew during this period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While he filled in many more flight logs during the war, we do not currently have access to them. If you have more flight logs - whether belonging to George or another crew member who flew with him, please upload using our&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lucent.myprivatecloud.uk/index.php/s/4i7RNmdjSsqWyxL&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secure drop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Christmas menu and invitation marked George Heritage. There are two dates on the menu: 1943 and 1945, and a number of locations where 338 Wing was either located or had bombed. These are Reghaia in Algeria, Livorno in Italy, and Wahed, Egypt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The menu begins with wine, then moves on to Sardines on toast as an entree. For mains, there is a choice of roast lamb or chicken, with a selection of potatoes and veg. For desert, there was fruit pudding, followed by a heady rum-pineapple-cream coffee, and chased down with cheese and biscuits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/menu_back.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/menu_back_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;A signed menu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attendees signed the back of the menu. The card is divided vertically with names on the right side denoted as ‘junior to you’.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If this was as the date suggests, Christmas 1945, the Axis powers had been defeated some months before, and the crews would be looking forward to either heading home or joining the war in the far east.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/useful_arabic.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/useful_arabic_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;A document in Arabic and English&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In case of emergency (such as being shot down over the Western Desert), crews were given documents written in Arabic and English, which could be presented to the locals, along with a few phrases which might help them. The document reads:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To All Arab Peoples - Greetings and Peace be upon you. The bearer of this letter is an Officer of the British Government and a friend of all Arabs. Treat him well, guard him from harm, give him food and drink, help him return to the nearest British soldiers and you will be rewarded. Peace and the Mercy of God upon you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The British High Command in the East.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The useful phrases are: ‘English’, ‘English Flying Officer’, ‘Friend’, and ‘Take me to the English and you will be rewarded.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/britain_russia_poem.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/britain_russia_poem_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;A typewritten poem on taped paper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A poem titled ‘Britain and Russia, and signed only ‘Liverpool’ paints a less than flattering picture of the USSR’s participation in the war to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The poem was originally called ‘Less Nonsense’ and was written in 1944 by Sir Alan Patrick Herbert - Humorist and MP for Oxford University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/italian_leaflet.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/italian_leaflet_lo_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two sides of a leaflet written in Italian&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siamo sbarcati come liberatori - we have landed as liberators&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is probably one of the leaflets dropped on Italian occupied Heraklion on May 8th 1942. Operation Albumen took place a month later, but Crete remained in Axis hands until “10 o’clock Greenwich Mean Time on the tenth day of May 1945”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
