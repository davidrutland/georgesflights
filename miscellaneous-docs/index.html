      <p><a href="/assets/images/menu_front.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/menu_front_lo_res.png" alt="A menu from Christmas 1945 addressed to Sgt Heritage" /></a></p>

<p><em>A Christmas menu and invitation marked George Heritage. There are two dates on the menu: 1943 and 1945, and a number of locations where 338 Wing was either located or had bombed. These are Reghaia in Algeria, Livorno in Italy, and Wahed, Egypt.</em></p>

<p><em>The menu begins with wine, then moves on to Sardines on toast as an entree. For mains, there is a choice of roast lamb or chicken, with a selection of potatoes and veg. For desert, there was fruit pudding, followed by a heady rum-pineapple-cream coffee, and chased down with cheese and biscuits.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/menu_back.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/menu_back_lo_res.png" alt="A signed menu" /></a></p>

<p><em>Attendees signed the back of the menu. The card is divided vertically with names on the right side denoted as ‘junior to you’.</em>
<em>If this was as the date suggests, Christmas 1945, the Axis powers had been defeated some months before, and the crews would be looking forward to either heading home or joining the war in the far east.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/useful_arabic.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/useful_arabic_lo_res.png" alt="A document in Arabic and English" /></a></p>

<p><em>In case of emergency (such as being shot down over the Western Desert), crews were given documents written in Arabic and English, which could be presented to the locals, along with a few phrases which might help them. The document reads:</em></p>

<p><em>To All Arab Peoples - Greetings and Peace be upon you. The bearer of this letter is an Officer of the British Government and a friend of all Arabs. Treat him well, guard him from harm, give him food and drink, help him return to the nearest British soldiers and you will be rewarded. Peace and the Mercy of God upon you.</em></p>

<p><em>The British High Command in the East.</em></p>

<p><em>The useful phrases are: ‘English’, ‘English Flying Officer’, ‘Friend’, and ‘Take me to the English and you will be rewarded.’</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/britain_russia_poem.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/britain_russia_poem_lo_res.png" alt="A typewritten poem on taped paper" /></a></p>

<p><em>A poem titled ‘Britain and Russia, and signed only ‘Liverpool’ paints a less than flattering picture of the USSR’s participation in the war to date.</em></p>

<p><em>The poem was originally called ‘Less Nonsense’ and was written in 1944 by Sir Alan Patrick Herbert - Humorist and MP for Oxford University.</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/italian_leaflet.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/italian_leaflet_lo_res.png" alt="Two sides of a leaflet written in Italian" /></a></p>

<p><em>Siamo sbarcati come liberatori - we have landed as liberators</em></p>

<p><em>This is probably one of the leaflets dropped on Italian occupied Heraklion on May 8th 1942. Operation Albumen took place a month later, but Crete remained in Axis hands until “10 o’clock Greenwich Mean Time on the tenth day of May 1945”</em></p>

<p><em>Feel free to drop me a complete translation.</em></p>
